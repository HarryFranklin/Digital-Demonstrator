Repository for my BSc Computer Science final year dissertation.

Instructions on how to run the project
- When the project is nearing completion, or fully complete, I will upload builds of the demonstrator, as this is the easiest way to get it deployed.
- Until then, cloning the repo, and adding the project by disk (through the Unity App). You will need the correct unity version (6000.0.38f1)
