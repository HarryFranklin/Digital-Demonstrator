Repository for my BSc Computer Science final year dissertation.

Instructions on how to run the project:
- The best way is to clone the repository, and add the project by this (through Unity Hub).
- The demonstrator was made with Unity version 6000.0.38f1.
- I would have uploaded builds of the demonstrator in different states for different platforms, but each build is >100MB, which GitHub doesn't support, unfortunately.
