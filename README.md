Repository for my BSc Computer Science final year dissertation.

My dissertation focuses on demonstrating the cascading effects of renewable energy infrastructure cyber attacks on critical national infrastructure (CNI).
The demonstrator is interactive, allowing you to launch simulated cyber attacks on grid infrastructure to disrupt remote monitoring functionality as well as introducing instability or power outages into the grid.
The goal of the project is to demonstrate the importance of securing the renewable energy industry against cyber attacks - in order to protect national security - to technical and non-technical stakeholders, policymakers or anyone interested in cyber security or renewable energy infrastructure.

Please find the Progress Recordings folder in order to view the project's development via short video demonstrations.

Instructions on how to run the project:
- The best way is to clone the repository, and add the project by this (through Unity Hub).
- The demonstrator was made with Unity version 6000.0.38f1.
- There is one build available in the Releases section of this repository.
